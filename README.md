# ML1819: Project 104 (Data Amount)
CS7CS4 Group Project : Project 104 (Data Amount)

Research Question:  How much data do you need to train machine learning algorithms effectively? 

The objective of this project is to find out how the performance of machine learning algorithms changes when the amount of data for training changes.

Experiment 1: Wine Quality Prediction (Branch: research_1)

Dataset - Contains data regarding wine quality, depending on various attributes. It is included as "winequality.csv" here.
(Source: https://www.kaggle.com/aleixdorca/wine-quality )

Aim - To predict the quality of wine from the given data, and to observe how prediction varies with increasing amount of data

Algorithms Used - a) Gaussian Naive Bayes
                  b) Decision Tree Classifier 
                  c) Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metrics - a) Accuracy 
                     b) F1 Score

Experiment 2: Mushroom Edibility Prediction (Branch: research_2)

Dataset- Contains data regarding Mushroom Quality (definitely edible, definitely poisonous, of unknown edibility and not recommended), included as "mushroom.csv" here. (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/ymotonskillupai/mushroomscsv )
